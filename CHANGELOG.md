## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-10 — Phase 1: Schwarzschild foundations

First substantive release. Closes Phase 1 of the 18-month
[ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md).

### Added

- `spacetime_lab.metrics.base.Metric` — abstract base class for Lorentzian
  metrics. Provides cached symbolic machinery for the inverse metric,
  Christoffel symbols, Riemann / Ricci tensors, Ricci scalar and
  Kretschmann scalar, plus numerical evaluation via `metric_at(**coords)`.
- `spacetime_lab.metrics.schwarzschild.Schwarzschild` — full implementation
  of the Schwarzschild solution in Schwarzschild coordinates
  `(t, r, theta, phi)` with signature `(-,+,+,+)` and geometric units
  `G = c = 1`. Includes:
  - `event_horizon()`, `isco()`, `photon_sphere()` (the three canonical radii)
  - `kretschmann_scalar(r)` and `kretschmann_scalar_at_horizon()`
  - `tortoise_coordinate(r)` with `r* -> -infty` at the horizon
  - `effective_potential(r, L, particle_type)` for massive and null geodesics
  - `kruskal_coordinates(t, r, region)` for Regions I and II of the
    maximally extended spacetime
  - `christoffel_symbols_explicit()` — the 13 non-zero components in
    closed form
  - `verify_christoffel_symbols()` — sanity check of the explicit
    formulas against the base-class symbolic computation
  - `surface_gravity()`, `hawking_temperature()`,
    `bekenstein_hawking_entropy()` (horizon thermodynamics preview)
  - `line_element_latex()` — canonical LaTeX rendering
- 26 pytest tests in `tests/test_schwarzschild.py` covering every
  method above.
- `notebooks/01_schwarzschild_basics.ipynb` — Phase 1 concept notebook
  interleaving narrative, LaTeX, and direct calls into the API, with a
  closing "Phase 1 gate" cell that asserts every physics claim. Runs
  end-to-end against the current implementation.

### Upstream contributions

Eight pull requests opened against
[`bilby-dev/bilby`](https://github.com/bilby-dev/bilby) as part of the
Phase 1 "learn by shipping" track. See the
[Upstream contributions section of the README](./README.md#upstream-contributions)
for the full list with links.

### Notes

- Signature convention: `(-,+,+,+)` (Wald).
- Units: `G = c = 1` throughout. Mass, time and length all have the same
  dimension in this system.
- All claims in the Phase 1 notebook are verified by the accompanying
  assert block; if anything regresses the notebook will fail loudly.
